# Misspecification of Correlation Structures in Longitudinal Gene Expression Studies
This GitHub repository stores the simulation and data analysis depicted in the manuscript titled “Misspecification of Correlation Structures in Longitudinal Gene Expression Studies.” An individual R script for each figure/table is provided. Each R script is “stand alone” and doesn't require previous R scripts to run. For example, Figure2.R does NOT require that Figure1.R be run first. When running simulations, the REML estimate of the gls function in R will fail to converge on rare occasions, typically when fitting AR or GAUS structures. We simply drop these runs and move forward through the loop, making a note of its existence with a warning. As for the simulation run times, Figure3.R takes the longest to simulate and has a run time of about 18 hours. Figure6.R is next in line and takes roughly a few hours. The other R scripts finish running in about 10 minutes or less.
